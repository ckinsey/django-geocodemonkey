django-geocodemonkey
====================

Geocodemonkey is a package that implements a thin layer ontop of the wonderful Geopy geocoders.

The goal is to adapt these tools for easily integrating common points in the Django framework.  This includes an integration with the Django cache layer to cache common queries, and tools for integrating geocoded data with Django models and Haystack search indexes.

Geocodemonkey is also designed for simple configuration and the ability to easily leverage multiple geocoding APIs simultaneously.
